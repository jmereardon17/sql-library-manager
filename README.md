# FSJS Techdegree Project 8

For this project I built a web application that will include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. HTML designs were given and an existing SQLite database. I was required to implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

Extras for the Exceeds Expectations Grading:

- Include a search filter for the books listing page. Search works for all of the following fields:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Genre
  - Year
- Include pagination for the books listing page.

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
